# SIRS Monitoring and Intrusion Recovery of Network Infrastructures

# Dependencies:

KerbIST is required to be installed by running:

'''
git clone https://github.com/tecnico-distsys/kerbist kerbist
cd kerbist
mvn clean install -DskipTests
'''

This places the required dependencies in the local maven .m2 repository to be imported from into other maven projects.
